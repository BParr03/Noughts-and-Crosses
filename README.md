# Noughts-and-Crosses
This project was created as a side project while i was on placement in my third year. It is a simple noughts and crosses game created in JavaScript, that allows users to take it in turns selecting a square and will announce the winner, ending the game, or will announce a draw if there is no winner after every square has been filled.
